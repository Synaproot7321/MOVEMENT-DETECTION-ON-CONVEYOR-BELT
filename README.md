# 🏭 MOVEMENT-DETECTION-ON-CONVEYOR-BELT

*NOTE: During my experience in the mining sector, I participated in the development of a visual inspection system using machine vision to detect movement in conveyor belts. Out of respect for confidentiality, no images or technical details of the actual system are shown. The documentation presented here is a simulated version developed by me for demonstration purposes.*

This project implements an image processing pipeline to **detect vertical motion** in conveyor belt systems using a video feed or a sequence of images. The primary goal is to determine whether a conveyor belt is **moving in the correct vertical direction** (upward or downward), which is especially useful in mining, logistics, and industrial automation scenarios where belts must operate in predefined patterns.

Unlike traditional monitoring systems that require physical sensors (encoders, proximity sensors, etc.), this solution is **completely vision-based** and relies only on a standard video camera and real-time frame analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

The algorithm is designed to:

- 🧭 **Identify vertical motion** in conveyor belts from video or image sequences.
- 🚫 **Filter out lateral or stationary movement**, focusing only on vertical direction changes.
- 📊 **Provide insights** that could help in fault detection, operational verification, or automation processes.

By eliminating the need for additional hardware, this approach lowers the cost and complexity of conveyor monitoring systems.

## 🧠 How Does It Work?

The algorithm follows a structured, image-based approach to detect vertical movement on a conveyor belt. Here's a breakdown of the main stages:

1. **Video Input**  
   The system processes a video of the conveyor belt.

2. **Frame Analysis**  
   Each frame is converted to grayscale and prepared for motion detection.

3. **Motion Detection**  
   The algorithm compares frames to detect movement.

4. **Vertical Filtering**  
   Only vertical motion (up/down) is analyzed. Horizontal movement is ignored.

5. **Result Classification**  
   If vertical movement is detected consistently, it is labeled as "Moving Vertically"; otherwise, it is flagged as stationary or irregular.

6. **Visual Output**  
   Results are saved with annotations for easy review.
